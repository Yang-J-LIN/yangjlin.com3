      text: |-
        I'm a doctoral assistant in the AQUA lab at EPFL. I am working on integrating neural networks near and within the SPAD sensors, especially recurrent neural networks and spiking neural networks.

        I design the ASIC SPAD image sensors, FPGA-based neural processing units, software for control and visualization, and optical setup for biomedical imaging applications, esp. fluorescence lifetime imaging.
        
        **I am currently open to work opportunities as a researcher or engineer, with a starting date around the end of 2025.** ðŸ˜ƒ
