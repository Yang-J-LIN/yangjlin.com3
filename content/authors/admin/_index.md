      Dissertation: *Subcellular localization of long noncoding RNA with interpretable deep learning*

      This study explores the application of natural language processing techniques to RNA sequences for predicting the subcellular localization of long noncoding RNAs. The [developed prediction software](http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/lncLocator2/) is deployed on a server, providing biologists with accessible and reliable tools for analysis. Supervisors: [Prof. Hong-Bin Shen and Prof. Xiaoyong Pan](http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/)

## About Me

I am currently a doctoral assistant at [AQUA Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/aqua/), EPFL. I am working on marrying single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) with artificial and spiking neural networks for biological and medical imaging.
